         * You will be creating a program that will convert temperatures.

         * 2. Your program should be able to do conversion from celsius to fahrenheit
         *
         * How this will work:
         * 1. You will prompt the user for what conversion they're looking to do:
         *  - a fahrenheit to celsius conversion
         *  - a celsius to fahrenheit conversion
         * 2. Once there, you will ask them what temperature they would like to convert
         * 3. You will do the conversion
         *  - fahrenheit to celsius equation:
         *  - celsius to fahrenheit equation:
         * 4. Print out the converted temperature.
