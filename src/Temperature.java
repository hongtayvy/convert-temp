         * You will be creating a program that will convert temperatures.
         * 1. Your program should be able to do conversion from fahrenheit to celsius
         * 2. Your program should be able to do conversion from celsius to fahrenheit
         *
         * How this will work:
         * 1. You will prompt the user for what conversion they're looking to do:
         *  - a fahrenheit to celsius conversion
         *  - a celsius to fahrenheit conversion
         * 2. Once there, you will ask them what temperature they would like to convert
         * 3. You will do the conversion
         *  - fahrenheit to celsius equation: (user's temperature - 32) x (5/9)
         *  - celsius to fahrenheit equation: (user's temperature x 1.8) + 32
         * 4. Print out the converted temperature.
         * 5. Ask user if they would like to do another conversion
         *  - If yes, repeat step 1 - 4
         *  - If no, exit
